Mingdong Song is an artist

我是一个艺术家

======

宋明东是我们团队的宝贵财富，他是一位好的合作伙伴，一个有视野的创新者，他尊重每个人的观点，着力引导并协调团队成员，挖掘大家的优点，以鼓励团队凝聚力和协作效率。他的热情和正能量感染了整个团队，使得大家在面对挑战时更有决心和平静。在春阳台的设计项目中，他是装置和创意部分的负责人，创造性的提出以中国传统文化，水墨的质感结合纱幕头晕来打造一个充满沉浸感的场域，为塑造整个项目的核心概念——“荷花君子”，做出了突出的贡献。


This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
